# AI Text Generation System - Question Description

## Overview

Build a Python application that integrates with Google's Gemini AI to create an interactive text generation system. This project demonstrates how to work with modern AI APIs, implement streaming responses, and create both command-line and programmatic interfaces for AI-powered applications.

## Project Objectives

1. **AI Service Integration:** Connect your Python application to Google's Gemini AI using official client libraries and proper authentication methods.

2. **Real-Time Streaming:** Implement streaming text generation where AI responses appear word-by-word in real-time, creating an engaging user experience.

3. **Dual Interface Design:**
   - Build a command-line interface with argument parsing and flexible options
   - Create a reusable Python function for integration into other applications

4. **Secure Configuration Management:** Learn to handle API keys and sensitive data using environment variables and configuration files.

5. **Production-Ready Testing:** Write comprehensive tests that validate real API interactions without using mocks or simulations.

## Key Features to Implement

- Core text generation function with configurable model selection and streaming options
- Interactive command-line tool supporting custom prompts and various output modes
- Environment-based API key management with fallback handling
- Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Configuration validation and security checks
  - AI response quality for different query types
  - Code generation and creative writing capabilities
  - Error handling and edge cases

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **API Integration Patterns:** Understanding authentication, request formatting, and response handling for external AI services
- **Streaming Data Management:** Processing real-time data chunks and managing user interface updates
- **Command-Line Tool Design:** Creating professional CLI applications with proper argument parsing and help documentation
- **Testing External Dependencies:** Writing reliable tests for applications that depend on third-party APIs
- **Security Best Practices:** Protecting sensitive credentials and implementing secure configuration management
- **Error Resilience:** Building robust applications that gracefully handle network issues and API limitations

## Expected Outcome

You will create a fully functional AI text generation system that can be used both as a standalone command-line tool and as a Python module in other projects. The system will demonstrate professional development practices including proper testing, security, and user interface design.

## Additional Considerations

- Explore advanced features like conversation history and context management
- Implement response caching to optimize API usage and reduce costs
- Add support for different output formats and file-based input/output
- Consider rate limiting and usage monitoring for production deployments
- Extend functionality with batch processing and concurrent request handling
